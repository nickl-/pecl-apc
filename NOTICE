APC is the Alternative PHP Cache.  It was conceived of to provide a free,
open, and robust framework for compiling and caching php scripts. This
extension is being released under the QPL for complete compliance with PHP
and to facilitate wide-spread use.  It is our intention that this project be
kept open source and that all commercial spin-offs contribute their
modifications back into the public source-tree.
